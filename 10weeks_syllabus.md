## Intro to Remote 10-weeks Courses

### Course Description

This 10-weeks remote course is a university course that features 10 weeks of intense, project-focused training inspired by our professional courses and facilitated by CodePath-trained Teaching Assistants. In the first half of the course, students develop skills by completing coding labs and building fully functional app assignment projects. In the second half of the course, students will apply their skills--working together in small teams--to design and and build an original app from the ground up. The course culminates in a Demo Day event where teams will present their finished apps in a live demo.
